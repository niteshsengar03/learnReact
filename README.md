# React Learning Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you through learning React while balancing tutorials and self-practice. By the end, you'll be able to build React projects independently.

## 1. Getting Started (Week 1)

### Tutorial Phase:
- **Goal**: Understand the basics of React.
- **Topics**:
  - What is React? (Single Page Applications, Virtual DOM)
  - JSX and rendering elements
  - Components and props
  - State and lifecycle

### Action:
- Follow the tutorial/course and build small components.
- Example: A simple `Counter` component with a button to increase a number.

### Project (With Tutorial):
- **Build a Static Website**: Create a personal portfolio using React components. Focus on organizing components and passing props.

---

## 2. State & Events (Week 2)

### Tutorial Phase:
- **Goal**: Master state management and event handling.
- **Topics**:
  - Handling user input (Forms and Events)
  - Conditional rendering
  - Lists and keys

### Action:
- Follow tutorials on state and event handling.
- Implement features like button click events or form handling.

### Project (Self-Practice):
- **Build a To-Do List App**: Use `useState` to manage tasks dynamically. Build this project **without a tutorial**.

---

## 3. React Hooks (Week 3)

### Tutorial Phase:
- **Goal**: Learn and apply React hooks.
- **Topics**:
  - Introduction to `useState` and `useEffect`
  - Component side effects
  - Fetching data with `useEffect`

### Action:
- Watch tutorials to learn hooks.
- Experiment with `useEffect` to fetch data from an API.

### Project (With Tutorial):
- **Build a Weather App**: Follow a tutorial to fetch data from a weather API using `useEffect`. Customize the UI afterward.

---

## 4. Routing & Navigation (Week 4)

### Tutorial Phase:
- **Goal**: Learn how to navigate between different pages in a React app.
- **Topics**:
  - React Router (setting up routes, navigation)
  - Nested routing and parameterized routes

### Action:
- Follow a tutorial to learn React Router.
- Build basic page navigation (Home, About, Contact pages).

### Project (Self-Practice):
- **Build a Multi-Page Blog**: Use React Router to create a blog with navigation between home, articles, and about pages. Build **without a tutorial**.

---

## 5. Advanced State Management (Week 5-6)

### Tutorial Phase:
- **Goal**: Learn advanced state management.
- **Topics**:
  - `useReducer` for complex state logic
  - Context API for global state management

### Action:
- Follow a tutorial to learn `useReducer` and Context API.
- Implement global state (e.g., theme switcher).

### Project (With Tutorial):
- **Build a Shopping Cart**: Use `useReducer` to manage the state of a shopping cart. Follow a tutorial, then customize features like saving the cart to local storage.

---

## 6. Form Validation & Optimization (Week 7)

### Tutorial Phase:
- **Goal**: Handle form validation and optimize performance.
- **Topics**:
  - Controlled vs. uncontrolled components
  - Form validation (Formik or manual)
  - Memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`)

### Action:
- Watch a tutorial on form validation and performance optimization.
- Experiment with form libraries like `Formik` or handle validation manually.

### Project (Self-Practice):
- **Build a User Registration Form**: Create a form with validation and optimization. Build **without a tutorial** and try implementing memoization for performance.

---

## 7. Final Capstone Project (Week 8-10)

### Project (Self-Practice):
- **Build a Full-Stack MERN App**: Build a complete app from scratch, without following a tutorial. Example projects:
  - Task Manager
  - Social Media Dashboard
  - E-commerce App

### Features to Include:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express.js
- State Management: Context API or Redux
- Authentication (Login/Signup)
- Deployment (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

---

## Bonus Tips:
- **Track your progress**: After each project, reflect on what you learned and where you struggled.
- **Avoid copying**: If you need help, refer to the tutorial but avoid copying code.
- **Challenge yourself**: Push your limits by adding extra features (dark mode, sorting, filtering, etc.).

---

### Summary
This roadmap will help you learn React progressively. Each phase combines tutorials and self-practice, ensuring you gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.
