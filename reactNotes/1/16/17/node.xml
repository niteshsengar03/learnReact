    <rich_text foreground="#cccccc" weight="heavy">Why do we use keys in React?</rich_text>
    <rich_text>
1. </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Unique Identification</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.
2. </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Efficient Updates</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: By using keys, React can match elements between renders and only update the changed elements, improving performance.
3. </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Avoiding Re-renders</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Without keys, React would re-render all elements in a list, which is inefficient.
